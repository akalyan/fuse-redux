# Fuse Redux Todos Example

The [Fuse Todos Example](https://www.fusetools.com/examples/todo-app) revamped with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as a demonstration of unidirectional data flow with a single atomic store.

A few notes:
- I've taken the concepts of ["Containers" and "Components"](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) and applied them here.
- There is an extension of the FuseJS/Observable class that experiments with a new, improved, version of the `refreshAll` API.
